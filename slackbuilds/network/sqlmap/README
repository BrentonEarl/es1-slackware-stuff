sqlmap is an open source command-line automatic SQL injection tool developed
in Python. Its goal is to detect and take advantage of SQL injection
vulnerabilities on web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL
injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of options
to perform an extensive back-end database management system fingerprint,
retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users, password hashes,
privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specific DBMS tables/columns, run
his own SQL statement, read specific files on the file system and more.
