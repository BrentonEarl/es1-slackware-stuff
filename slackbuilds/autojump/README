autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line. The jumpstat command shows you the current contents
of the database. You need to work a little bit before the database
becomes usable. Autojump will listen and rank your 'cd' commands by
frequency. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump"
to a commonly "cd"ed directory.
