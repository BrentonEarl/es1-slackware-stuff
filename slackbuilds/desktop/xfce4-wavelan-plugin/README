xfce4-wavelan-plugin

-------
About
-------

This plugin is used to display stats from a wireless lan 
interface (signal state, signal quality, network name 
(SSID)). It supports NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Linux.

It shows signal quality as percentage on Linux and dBm on 
BSDs, hence progressbar will probably be not really 
accurate on BSDs, as dBm is hardly comparable to a maximum.

-------
Usage
-------

Add the plugin to the panel, and select the 
wireless interface you want to monitor.
