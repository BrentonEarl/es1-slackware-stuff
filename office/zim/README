Zim is a graphical text editor and organizer with wiki-like features
such as linking to other pages in a notebook. Zim stores data in
plain text for simplicity and transparency.

Among other uses, zim can be effective for brainstorming, note-taking,
and making task lists.

Zim can optionally use pyxdg and xdg-utils 
(http://portland.freedesktop.org/download/) for additional 
freedesktop.org standard support

By default, zim enables the version control plugin, which can
optionally use bzr.
