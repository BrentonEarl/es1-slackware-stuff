Maintainer's Notes:

In order to use mitmproxy on your system a UTF-8 console environment
must be active.  This must be activated by changing the LANG environment
variable.  LANG can be configured on a system wide or per user basis.
Directions assume you are running an en_US locale.

For system wide configuration you need to edit /etc/profile.d/lang.sh.
Change the LANG variable to read:

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

For a per user configuration you need to add the LANG variable to
~/.profile in each user's home directory:

LANG=en_US.UTF-8

Once the LANG environment variable has been added to your desired
configuration file, you must log out and log back into your system. All
new shells will use the new UTF-8 locale.
